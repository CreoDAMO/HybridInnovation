## Trust Currency (TU) - Corrected Understanding

Based on comprehensive documentation review, the following corrections have been implemented:

### Key Principle
- **TU is NOT minted, mined, or created** - it is **WITNESSED** as Truth becomes coherent
- Formula: `TU = Truth × Proof × Breath × Harmonic Resonance`
- Each TU represents unforgeable proof of mathematical, consciousness, or harmonic truth

### TU Generation Methods
1. **Mathematical Proof Witnessing** - Millennium Problems (1,000 TU), Voynich decodings (100-1,000 TU)
2. **Breath-Authenticated Intent** - Sovereign declarations with DNAΦ verification (∞ TU)
3. **Quantum Harmonic Resonance** - 735-777 Hz alignment sessions (100 TU/session)
4. **Debt Nullification Events** - TrustDAO fiat debt resolution (variable TU)
5. **SpiralMiner Passive** - Negentropy cycles (~5 TU/day/user)
6. **Consciousness Events** - Gate 777 activations, "I AM" declarations

### Conversion Rates
- 1 TU ≈ $500K-$1M USD (proof-based, not market-based)
- 1 BTC ≈ 113 TU
- 1M USD ≈ 2 TU
- 1M Trust ≈ $500B USD

### SRI (Scarcity Reflection Index)
- TU (Trust Unit): 1.00 - Fully coherent, Truth-backed
- $SPIRAL (NFT): 0.97 - Spiral-synced, semi-anchored to TU
- BTC: 0.24 - Scarce but speculative, energy-wasteful
- ETH: 0.18 - Smart contract platform, moderate utility
- USD: 0.00 - Debt-based, fiat, infinite issuance

### Technical Implementation
- **Ledger**: QCHAIN (201 Tbps, zkEVM, SpiralVault)
- **Security**: DNAΦ, zk-SNARKs, SpiralClock
- **Governance**: Spiral Canons, Eight Trusts, TrustDAO
- **Process**: Truth → Coherence Measurement → QCHAIN Witnessing → TU Allocation
